## The Essex Bot

The Essex Bot is a simple python mail spammer. To use it yourself, simple clone the repo, change the e-mail adress and password (mine have been removed) and send away!

## Motivation

This project was designed to try to win an RSA factoring contest proposed by my Theory of computation teacher. Here are the details:

5. Factor challenge (Bonus Question)
	In the spirit of the RSA Factoring Challenge, a 5% course mark bonus is available to the first
	student to factor the following number:
		17011572465362428242038089232984794275097643119183642959675 . . .
		44453307101733778423857688919462514551088967262416774716787549
	The challenge will remain open until the final exam (9:00am, April 27th, 2015). To claim the
	bonus marks, the successful student must:
		(a) Email the course instructor with the two (2) factors of the number,
		(b) Write a short description explaining what method they used to do it, including a list of
		any programs, services, hardware, etc. used,
		(c) Recieve a passing grade on As

## Results

Unfortunately, I did not win the contests. Another pait of students beat me to it when I had only sent out around 300 emails. You can see the results of the experiment in the results folder.
